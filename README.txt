To run project in virtualenv, do those steps:
1. Install "virtualenv" via pip
Note: You can also use "venv" instead of "virtualenv". But "virtualenv" is more popular and powerful than "venv".

2. Create virtualenv "env" folder by using:
	"py -3 -m virtualenv env"
	on linux: "virtualenv env"
	
3. Activate virtualenv:
	"env\Scripts\activate" (.ps1 - PowerShell script)
	on linux: ". env/bin/activate" or "source env/bin/activate" (.sh - bash script)
	
Note1: 	When "Script cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system" run in cmd: "powershell Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned"
	After all you can deactivate this policy by running in cmd: "powershell Set-ExecutionPolicy Restricted"
	from: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4037939/powershell-says-execution-of-scripts-is-disabled-on-this-system
Note2:
	1) "./script" runs the script as an executable file, launching a new shell to run it
	2) ". script" or "source script" reads and executes commands from filename in the current shell environment
		
4. Install required packages via pip (here are "flask" and "flask-sqlalchemy")
Note1: You can install required packages listed in .txt file via: "python -m pip install -r requirements.txt"
Note2: Installed libraries should be visible in "env\Lib\site-packages" folder
Note3: Don't use "py -3 -m pip install ...". Here our python.exe is in folder "env\Scripts" (In cmd you can use "where python" and see where it is)
	So just simply use "python -m pip install ..."
		
5. Run prepared scipt with:
	"python src/app.py" (or change directory of main file)
	
Note: Server runs at url: "localhost:5000"

6. Deactivate virtualenv (while beeing in active environment):
	"deactivate"


Additional:
a) Creation of database:
- Enable virtualenv (3rd point),
- Move to "src" folder,
- Run "python" and write:
>>> from app import app, db
>>> app.app_context().push()
>>> db.create_all()
Db is created in folder "src\instance\test.db"

b) Updating database (https://flask-migrate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/):
- Enable virtualenv (3rd point),
- Move to "src" folder,
- Install pip "Flask-Migrate" package,
- In project import "flask_migrate" from "Migrate" and create instantion of migration: "migrate = Migrate(app, db)",
- In opened virtualenv terminal do:
	- Create migration repository: "python -m flask db init",
	- Generate initial migration: "python -m flask db migrate -m 'Initial migration.'",
	- Apply changes described in migration script to db: "python -m flask db upgrade".	

Each time the database models change, repeat the "migrate" and "upgrade" commands (without "db init" command).

c) Copy complete virtualenv to another pc (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34993200/copy-complete-virtualenv-to-another-pc):
1) On source machine:
- Enable virtualenv (3rd point),
- Create requirements file: "python -m pip freeze > requirements.txt",
2) On other pc:
- Copy "requirements.txt" from source machine to destination pc (into the root folder of the project),
- Enable virtualenv (3rd point),
- Install requirements: "python -m pip install -r requirements.txt",
- Delete the "requirements.txt" file.
